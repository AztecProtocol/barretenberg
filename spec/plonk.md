# PlonK

We describe the PlonK variants as implemented in Barretenberg. This differs from what is described in \cite PlonK in several respects. These include:
 - The presence of custom gates (see...); in particular
     - The use of Plookup.
     - Implementation of ROM and RAM (see...)
 - The use of generalized permutation argument range constraints in the Turbo and Ultra variants (see...)
 - The use of R
 - The handling of public inputs through a modification of the grand product argument (see...)
 - The absence of Maller's linerization optimization (see...)
 - The use of "short scalars" (see...)
