 * @brief Specify the structure of a CircuitConstructor
 *
 * @details This is typically passed as a template argument specifying the structure of a circuit constructor. It
 * should only ever contain circuit constructor data--it should not contain data that is particular to any
 * proving system.
 *
 * @remark It may make sense to say this is only partial arithmetization data, with the full data being
 * contained in the circuit constructor. We could change the name of this class if it conflicts with common usage.
 *
 * @tparam _num_wires
